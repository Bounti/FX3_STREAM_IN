Setting up the Cypress tool-chain
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Before compiling you must install the Cypress Linux SDK and follow the instructions in the 
FX3_SDK_Linux_Support PDF section 2.  The PDF is located in:

~/FX3_SDK_1.3.4_Linux/fx3_firmware_linux/cyfx3sdk

(Provided you copied the Cypress tarball to your home directory).

If you are running a 64-bit OS (which you should be) - follow section 2.1 step 3 and enter
the following command:

apt-get install lib32z1

No other parts of section 2.1 are required.

The section 2.2 instructions require you to set up a number of environment variables.  These
should be placed in your ~/.profile file so they are loaded everytime you log in.  The required
variables are as follows:

# Environment variables for Cypress FX3
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/FX3_SDK_1.3.4_Linux/ARM_GCC/arm-2013.11/bin
export FX3_INSTALL_PATH=$HOME/FX3_SDK_1.3.4_Linux/fx3_firmware_linux/cyfx3sdk
export ARMGCC_INSTALL_PATH=$HOME/FX3_SDK_1.3.4_Linux/ARM_GCC/arm-2013.11
export ARMGCC_VERSION=4.8.1
export CYUSB_ROOT=$HOME/FX3_SDK_1.3.4_Linux/cyusb_linux_1.0.5

Once the environment variables are set (and you have loaded them by logging back into your
user account.  Compile the elf2img program as follows (section 2.1 step 7):

cd $FX3_INSTALL_PATH/util/elf2img
gcc elf2img.c –o elf2img –Wall


Compiling the Domesday Duplicator FX3 Firmware
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
To compile the Domesday Duplicator FX3 firmware, first change directory to the source directory:

cd ~/github/FX3-Firmware/domesdayDuplicator

Then compile the firmware image using the command:

make all

Note: The Cypress version of Eclipse is *not* required.


Programming the FX3
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
To load the firmware onto the FX3 device use the Cypress cyusb_linux tool (please see the cypress
documentation for installation instructions).  The steps are as follows:

 1. Close/short jumper J4 (PMODE) on the FX3 Superspeed board
 2. Power off the FX3 and then power it on again
 3. Load the cyusb_linux application
 4. Highlight the FX3 bootloader device at the top of the window
 5. Click on the ‘program’ tab
 6. Select I2C EEPROM
 7. Click on ‘select file’ and select the FX3 programming file from disk (use the .img file from the Release directory)
 8. Click on ‘Start download’ to write the programming file to the device
 9. Wait for programming to complete
10. Remove the jumper from J4
11. Power off the FX3 and then power it on again
